# Project context for AI assistants

Read these files in order:
1. [README.md](README.md) — what this dataset is, quality case, key findings
2. [BACKGROUND.md](BACKGROUND.md) — health history, genetics, substances, locations, weighing protocol
3. [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) — testable hypotheses organized by data requirements
4. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — completed work, next steps, known data quality notes

## Key principles
- **The data is complete.** Every day is fully logged. A 10-calorie day is a real fasting day, not incomplete logging. Never assume missing entries.
- **Accuracy is unusually high.** Food scale always used. ~10% consistent undercount from uncounted snacking (quantified by energy balance model, uniform across phases). Incentive structure rewards precision over undercounting.
- **CICO is effect, not cause.** The working theory is a meandering set point controlled by an unknown homeostat. Simple calorie correlation has been tried and drifts.

## Documentation standard
- Every new or revised result paragraph added to `README.md`, `FINDINGS.md`, or `ROADMAP.md` must include the exact command that emits the key numbers immediately below the prose block.
- When a script writes a stable file artifact, add an `Artifact:` line below the `Command:` line naming the output CSV or plot.
- Prefer standalone analysis scripts in `analysis/` that print their headline numbers directly, so prose claims remain mechanically reproducible.

## Extraction pipeline
All extractors are idempotent. Re-run to regenerate CSVs from raw data.
```
# Data extraction (order doesn't matter)
python intake/merge.py              → intake/intake_foods.csv + intake/intake_daily.csv
python intake/verify.py             — full integrity check (run after every merge)
python weight/extract.py            → weight/weight.csv
python steps-sleep/extract.py       → steps-sleep/steps.csv + steps-sleep/sleep.csv
python composition/extract.py       → composition/composition.csv
python RMR/extract.py               → RMR/rmr.csv
python drugs/extract.py             → drugs/medicine.csv + drugs/tirzepatide.csv
python intake/sanity_check.py       — Atwater factor validation
python intake/compare_extractors.py — cross-validates OXPS vs HTML extractors

# Analysis pipeline (order matters)
python analysis/P0_tune_glycogen.py    — parameter tuning (run once to derive P1 constants)

```

## CSV column reference

### intake/intake_foods.csv
`date, meal, food, calories, carbs_g, fat_g, protein_g, cholest_mg, sodium_mg, sugars_g, fiber_g, source`
- `meal`: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Supper, or TOTAL
- `source`: `html`, `mhtml`, or `oxps`
- Empty nutrient = unknown (`--` in MFP), not zero
- Priority waterfall: HTML > MHTML > OXPS

### intake/intake_daily.csv
`date, calories, carbs_g, fat_g, protein_g, cholest_mg, sodium_mg, sugars_g, fiber_g`

### intake/diet_epochs.csv
`start, end, label, detail` — manually annotated diet phases from food-level inspection. 22 epochs covering the full 2011-2026 period. Labels: `initial_restriction`, `keto_phase_1`, `weekend_fasting`, `enlightened_era`, `tirzepatide_era`, etc.

### weight/weight.csv
`date, weight_lbs, time` — first reading of day (fasted, post-sleep)

### steps-sleep/steps.csv
`date, steps, distance, speed` — deduplicated phone+watch

### steps-sleep/sleep.csv
`date, sleep_start, sleep_end, sleep_hours, time_offset` — assigned to wake-up date

### composition/composition.csv
`date, measured_at, source, device, era, weight_lbs, fat_mass_lbs, fat_pct, lean_mass_lbs, smm_lbs, bmi, [extended columns]`
- `era`: `bodpod`, `inbody_partial`, `inbody_full`, `inbody_summary`
- `lean_mass_lbs` = `weight_lbs - fat_mass_lbs` (always derived, not raw InBody "Lean Mass" column which is dry lean mass)
- Extended columns include water compartments, visceral fat, segmental muscle/fat, ECW ratios, waist circumference, phase angle
- Extracted from InBody CSV exports + BOD POD rows in XLSX. InBody preferred when dates overlap.

### RMR/rmr.csv
`date, rmr_kcal, device, fasted`

### drugs/tirzepatide.csv
`date, dose_mg, days_since_injection, injection_date, blood_level, effective_level`
- `blood_level`: PK model (FDA: t½=5d, Tmax=24h, ka=3.31/day), sums all prior injections
- `effective_level`: `blood_level × exp(-0.0217 × weeks_on_current_dose)` — tachyphylaxis-adjusted

### analysis/P1_smoothed_weight.csv
`date, weight_lbs, glycogen_g, glycogen_correction_lbs, sodium_correction_lbs, smoothed_weight_lbs`
- Corrections centered on median (typical day ≈ 0 correction)
- 1-day lag: morning weight reflects previous day's intake

### analysis/P2_daily_composition.csv
`date, weight_lbs, fm_lbs, ffm_lbs, fat_pct, expected_rmr`
- FM/FFM linearly interpolated between composition anchors
- `expected_rmr`: individually fitted model (RMR = a×FFM_kg + b×FM_kg + c)

### analysis/P3_daily_weight.csv
`date, calories, carbs_g, sodium_mg, observed_weight_lbs, glycogen_g, glycogen_correction_lbs, interpolated_weight_lbs, smoothed_weight_lbs, tdee, window_id`
- Window-based TDEE derivation (constant per 7+ day window)

### analysis/P4_kalman_daily.csv
`date, fat_mass_lbs_filtered, fat_mass_std_filtered, tdee_filtered, tdee_std_filtered, fat_mass_lbs, fat_mass_std, tdee, tdee_std, innovation`
- `*_filtered` columns are causal estimates available on that date
- Unsuffixed `fat_mass_lbs` / `tdee` are retrospective RTS-smoothed estimates using future weigh-ins
- Mean-reverting TDEE pulled toward composition-aware expected RMR

## Known pitfalls
- **Dry lean mass vs total lean mass**: InBody XLSX column 5 ("Lean Mass") contains dry lean mass (protein + minerals, ~38 lbs), not total lean mass (~140 lbs including water). Always derive lean mass as `weight - fat_mass`. The InBody CSV exports have the correct column names.
- **Off-by-one in TDEE derivation**: Morning weight reflects food eaten *yesterday* (you weigh before eating). TDEE windows must use intake from days s..e-1, not s..e. Including day e's intake caused 200 lbs of cumulative drift before the fix.

## Raw data notes
- OXPS `--` (unknown) nutrient values render as `0`. In the merged CSV, these are empty strings from HTML/MHTML but `0` from OXPS-only years (2013-2017). Biases cholesterol, sugars, fiber low in those years.
- 4.9% of food items fail Atwater validation. Sugar alcohol products (expected) and alcohol (7 cal/g not tracked as any macro). A handful are bad MFP database entries.
- Scale body fat % is unreliable. Use composition/ for body fat data.
- Normal sleep cycle is 3am to 11am. Very little sunlight exposure.
- Temperature mean ~97.7°F, nearly 1°F below textbook. Aug 30-31 2024 readings >101°F are COVID vaccine reaction.
